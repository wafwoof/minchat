# [minchat](https://minchat-nostr.vercel.app)

This is a simple hybrid nostr client. 4 event kinds are supported: Notes (1), Bitchat (20000/23333), and longform posts (30023).

MinChat supports proof-of-work and simple (but pretty solid) end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for channels and direct messages using AES-GCM.

Contact me if you have any questions or suggestions. Thanks.
